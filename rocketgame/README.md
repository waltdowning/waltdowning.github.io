# "Space Rocket" game

This little rocket game is adapted from the Phaser platformer tutorial at http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game. The sprites are drawn with [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/).

## Future plans
* Implement a toggle for turning the Fuel aspect of the game on and off.
* Re-randomize the platforms when certain scores are reached.
* Add mobile controls.
